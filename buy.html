    <h2>Other Information</h2>

    <p>Straight from our readers comes a new take on our discontinued Leech-in-a-box product. Delight your enemies with the sheer insanity of 2,999 fly larvae (counted exactly) that comes with its own custom tag.

      Larvae are shipped in a 5kg cubic styrofoam box. They are hungry and vicious. As is with all our products, they are sustainably and ethically sourced in our local Canadian suburbs.</p>
